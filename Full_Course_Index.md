# Introduction to Bulk RNA-seq data analysis

![](images/CRUK_Cambridge_Institute.png)

## Outline

In this workshop, you will be learning how to analyse RNA-seq data. This will
include read alignment, quality control, quantification against a reference,
reading the count data into R, performing differential expression analysis, and
gene set testing, with a focus on the DESeq2 analysis workflow. You will learn
how to generate common plots for analysis and visualisation of gene expression
data, such as boxplots and heatmaps.

This workshop is aimed at biologists interested in learning how to perform
differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> __**Some basic experience of using a UNIX/LINUX command line is assumed**__
>
> __**Some R knowledge is assumed and essential. Without it, you will struggle on this course.**__
> If you are not familiar with the R statistical programming language we
> strongly encourage you to work through an introductory R course before
> attempting these materials.
> We recommend our [Introduction to R course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intro/)

## Data, software and materials

The lecture slides and other source materials, including R code and
practical solutions, can be found in the course's [Github
repository](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/Reverse_Summer_School_2024_RNAseq)

The full data used in the course can be [downloaded from dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sz44que2vha44xw/AABISE1DdBSS6s_zLoW1vuCGa?st=z95zfjyg&dl=0). **Do not** attempt to 
download the entire directory, it is very large. Just download the files as you
need them.

Instructions to install software are available from the "[Software installation instructions](Markdowns/setup.html)" page.

## Extended materials

The [Extended Materials](Extended_index.md) contain extensions to some of the
sessions and additional materials, including instruction on downloading and
